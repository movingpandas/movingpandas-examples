    "This notebook presents a systematic movement data exploration workflow. \n",
    "The workflow consists of five main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establishing an overview** by visualizing raw input data records\n",
    "2. **Putting records in context** by exploring information from consecutive movement data records (such as: time between records, speed, and direction)\n",
    "3. **Extracting trajectories, locations & events** by dividing the raw continuous tracks into individual trajectories, locations, and events\n",
    "4. **Exploring patterns** in trajectory and event data by looking at groups of the trajectories or events\n",
    "5. **Analyzing outliers** by looking at potential outliers and how they may challenge preconceived assumptions about the dataset characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is demonstrated using horse collar tracking data provided by Prof. Lene Fischer (University of Copenhagen) and the Center for Technology & Environment of Guldborgsund Municipality in Denmark but should be generic enough to be applied to other tracking datasets."
